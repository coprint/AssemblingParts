# BLV Mount
Adapter mount for the Chromahead for printers upgraded with the BLV Ender mod.

3x Heatset inserts are required for the head mount, i used M3xOD4.6xH4.0

The mount fixes directly onto the MGN12H rail via 4 x M3x5 hex head screws

The original BLV "Belt Locker Plate" is reused and fixed with 3 x M3 hex head screws

I printed in PEGT 0.2mm layer, recomend a higher wall loop number to increase strength around the mounts.

ABS or similar may be needed for an enclosed printer
